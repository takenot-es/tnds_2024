description: Rebranding for a local, couple-owned store from rural Illinois.
problem: I was tasked with exploring options for a small mom & pop outdoors store in rural Illinois selling outdoor gear, camping gear, and items in that category.
solution: Ultimately the budget cashed out with the pandemic, but the branding explored iconology from state parks around the area, and paired it with a rustic, hand done feel.
