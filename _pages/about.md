                    Takenotes Design Studio is the design studio (desk in my living room) of me, Ryan Underwood. I am a non-award-winning (It's all politics and I never submit anyways. I'm not bitter.) designer, leader, and somewhat of a front-end developer.

                    Right now I work at the convergence of operations, branding, marketing, and systems/operations. That is a few ten-dollar words to just say I help companies build their branding, and organize and operationalize it.

                        The real biography:
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a designer with many moons of experience. If I am being honest, I lost count of how many years. Starting with a pirated version of Adobe Photoshop and making materials for various bands I was in during my early 20s, I learned some early on-set soft skills. Some of these skills being client management, and others including learning the hardway about the neccessity of a contract in a freelance working relationship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my career, I have been fortunate-enough to work for some great companies to help them to grow through design, strategy, and systematic development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When not plopped down in front of a computer hitting command + k in Figma, or in VSCODE you can typically find me reading, playing guitar, working out, or complaining that my knees are sore (most likely from working out).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have not hit the "smoking meat" phase of life. Yet. Though... I do have some Aaron Franklin and Matty Matheson cookbooks.

                    Thanks, Chef.
