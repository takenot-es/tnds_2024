description: Developing a brand for a small but ambitious mortgage start up.
problem: Adapt Mortgage wasn't a typical project for me. The idea was to create a subsidiary of a much larger company and have access to its resources. They wanted to position the company as a younger, more tech-savvy light with a simplistic branding style.
solution: The logo is a house, but also a monogram made of the initials of the company. The colors were derived from the parent company but changed to be more impactful and monochromatic versus green, blue, and orange. The layouts were cleaner and more simplistic in style and did away with the often over-designed and dated feel of most banks.
