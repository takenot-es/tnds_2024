description: Revitalizing a decades old mortgage institution.
problem: Princeton had an outdated design system, web infrastructure, and weak messaging surrounding their decades old reputation, skill set, and ability to close loans.
solution: Beginning with the team/recruiting site as an adventure to revitalize the brand, move to a static site via Jekyll and CloudCannon, update colors, and typography. Most of the messaging was building a stonger tagline around their "Effortless Mortgage", softening colors to be friendlier to the consumer, and bringing in design patterns and image containers to make designs more dynamic.
