description: The world's fastest design project for a minimum viable product. Probably ever.
problem: CredEvolv was working with an outdated product, branding, and no design system to build new features at an effective rate.
solution: Working on a very (understatement) limited timeline&colon; we needed to update their current product to be more visually appealing building on their working functionality. As a concurrent project we focused on updating their branding, creating various elements to start the building blocks of their Monarch Design System, and worked with back-end developers to get the new product live. As a result 4 products were redesigned, a new brand voice and elements were pushed live, and a design system base was built... in two months.
